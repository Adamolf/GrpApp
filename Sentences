Medium (Simple sentences):
  - The word "astronaut" comes from the Greek words meaning "star" and "sailor." These men and women bring up images of bravery and amazement. They are heroes helping humans reach for the stars. When the space program began, there were only seven such people in the entire country. They all were then - or had been in the past - in the armed forces. Most of them were test pilots, used to the dangers that came from "pushing the envelope." That was only 36 years ago, and since then much has changed. Today the Americans who make up the shuttle crews are comprised of every race, creed, color, and gender. As of May the second, there were over two hundred astronauts. NASA chooses its astronauts from a big pool of people. Lots of entries come in from all over the world; from these; roughly one hundred men and women are chosen for an hard training program every two years. "I cannot imagine a better job. I have done more than I ever could have imagined. I am thankful that I've been at the right place at the right time."
  - Once upon a time, a Wolf decided to disguise the way he looked. He thought it would help him get food more easily. He put on the skin of a sheep, then he went out with the flock into the field. Even the shepherd was fooled by his clever costume. In the evening, the shepherd put him in with the rest of the sheep. He closed the gate and made sure it was secure before he went to bed. In the middle of the night, he came back to the fold to get some meat for the next day. Instead of a sheep, though, he grabbed the Wolf, killing him instantly.
