Medium (Simple sentences):
  - The word "astronaut" comes from the Greek words meaning "star" and "sailor." These men and women bring up images of bravery and amazement. They are heroes helping humans reach for the stars. When the space program began, there were only seven such people in the entire country. They all were then - or had been in the past - in the armed forces. Most of them were test pilots, used to the dangers that came from "pushing the envelope." That was only thirty six years ago, and since then much has changed. Today the Americans who make up the shuttle crews are comprised of every race, creed, color, and gender. As of May the second, there were over two hundred astronauts. NASA chooses its astronauts from a big pool of people. Lots of entries come in from all over the world; from these; roughly one hundred men and women are chosen for an hard training program every two years. 
  - Once upon a time, a Wolf decided to disguise the way he looked. He thought it would help him get food more easily. He put on the skin of a sheep, then he went out with the flock into the field. Even the shepherd was fooled by his clever costume. In the evening, the shepherd put him in with the rest of the sheep. He closed the gate and made sure it was secure before he went to bed. In the middle of the night, he came back to the fold to get some meat for the next day. Instead of a sheep, though, he grabbed the Wolf, killing him instantly.
  - The right words can right your balance. The right words can light your way. But words can also have weight. In our life and work, we have to carry what is important, and leave much of the rest behind. Life is hard, but life is also amazing. It's full of opportunities. You just have to go out there and look for them. Remember, what you look for, you will find. You must see with eyes unclouded by hate. See the good in that which is evil, and the evil in that which is good. Pledge yourself to neither side, but vow instead to preserve the balance that exists between the two.
  
Hard (Formatted, grammar, hard words):
  - Independence Day, commonly known as the Fourth of July, is a federal holiday in the United States commemorating the adoption of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, declaring independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain. As a federal holiday, all non-essential federal institutions (like the postal service and federal courts) are closed on that day. Independence Day is commonly associated with fireworks, parades, barbecues, carnivals, fairs, picnics, concerts, baseball games, family reunions, political speeches and ceremonies, and various other public and private events celebrating the history, government, and traditions of the United States. Independence Day is the national day of the United States.
  - Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is a nucleic acid that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living organisms (with the exception of RNA viruses). The main role of DNA molecules is the long-term storage of information. Deoxyribonucleic acid is often compared to a set of blueprints, like a recipe or a code, since it contains the instructions needed to construct other components of cells, such as proteins and RNA molecules. The deoxyribonucleic acid segments that carry this genetic information are called genes, but other DNA sequences have structural
purposes, or are involved in regulating the use of this genetic information.
  - A tornado is a violently rotating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a cumulonimbus cloud or, in rare cases, the base of a cumulus cloud. They are often referred to as twisters or cyclones. Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes, but they are typically in the form of a visible condensation funnel, whose narrow end touches the
earth and is often encircled by a cloud of debris and dust. Most tornadoes have wind speeds less than 110 miles per hour (177 km/h), are about 250 feet (76 m) across, and travel a few miles (several kilometers) before dissipating. The most extreme tornadoes can attain wind speeds of more than 300 miles per hour (483 km/h).

V.Hard (Shakespearean):
  - 'oh this fusty thing. ' calen did laugh as that gent pick'd a leaf from his receiveth up.  'stage outfit, i'm going to beest missing out the lasteth showeth so mine own und'rstudy is taking the final showeth which maketh our second lasteth showeth mine own lasteth showeth.  And as tradition dictates, thee bray out thy lasteth showeth of a runneth which simply means i shall bray out with oth'rs rath'r than mine own fellow danc'rs. ' calen respond'd as that gent did study the fusty'r sir out of the c'rn'r of his eye.  The whey-face green coat with yellow trim wast hardly the most exotic getup calen hadst seen coequal in the bar itself but th're wast clearly something m're to this 'mast'r lant'rn' yond and calen wast eag'r to findeth out what.  
  - Coequal with the sloweth application, the anon excruciatingly base aura res'rves lash backeth hard'r and hard'r, f'rcing jocelyn to holdeth backeth h'r owneth tears--not of feareth but of pain--in 'rd'r to healeth both prism's mental and physical state.  Anon enow, though, h'r corse is did push to its physical limit, and the lady but soft topples to one side, h'r aura all but drain'd and h'r mind nearly unconscious from the draineth.  The steam cloud but soft starts to rise--whatev'r jocelyn hast done shall beest f'r naught if 't be true their cov'r fully vanishes.
  - â€œto beest, 'r not to beest: yond is the questioneth:wheth'r 'tis nobl'r in the mind to suff'r the slings and arrows of outrageous f'rtune, or to taketh arms 'gainst a flote of troubles, and by opposing endeth those folk? to kicketh the bucket: to catch but a wink; nay m're; and by a catch but a wink to sayeth we endeth the heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks yond flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation devoutly to beest wisheth'd.  To kicketh the bucket, to catch but a wink; to catch but a wink: p'rchance to dreameth: ay, th're's the rubbeth; f'r in yond catch but a wink of death what dreams may cometh at which hour we has't shuffl'd off this m'rtal coileth, wilt giveth us pauseth.
