Medium (Simple sentences):
  - The word "astronaut" comes from the Greek words meaning "star" and "sailor." These men and women bring up images of bravery and amazement. They are heroes helping humans reach for the stars. When the space program began, there were only seven such people in the entire country. They all were then - or had been in the past - in the armed forces. Most of them were test pilots, used to the dangers that came from "pushing the envelope." That was only thirty six years ago, and since then much has changed. Today the Americans who make up the shuttle crews are comprised of every race, creed, color, and gender. As of May the second, there were over two hundred astronauts. NASA chooses its astronauts from a big pool of people. Lots of entries come in from all over the world; from these; roughly one hundred men and women are chosen for an hard training program every two years. 
  - Once upon a time, a Wolf decided to disguise the way he looked. He thought it would help him get food more easily. He put on the skin of a sheep, then he went out with the flock into the field. Even the shepherd was fooled by his clever costume. In the evening, the shepherd put him in with the rest of the sheep. He closed the gate and made sure it was secure before he went to bed. In the middle of the night, he came back to the fold to get some meat for the next day. Instead of a sheep, though, he grabbed the Wolf, killing him instantly.
  - The right words can right your balance. The right words can light your way. But words can also have weight. In our life and work, we have to carry what is important, and leave much of the rest behind. Life is hard, but life is also amazing. It's full of opportunities. You just have to go out there and look for them. Remember, what you look for, you will find. You must see with eyes unclouded by hate. See the good in that which is evil, and the evil in that which is good. Pledge yourself to neither side, but vow instead to preserve the balance that exists between the two.
  
Hard (Formatted, grammar, hard words):
  - Independence Day, commonly known as the Fourth of July, is a federal holiday in the United States commemorating the adoption of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, declaring independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain. As a federal holiday, all non-essential federal institutions (like the postal service and federal courts) are closed on that day. Independence Day is commonly associated with fireworks, parades, barbecues, carnivals, fairs, picnics, concerts, baseball games, family reunions, political speeches and ceremonies, and various other public and private events celebrating the history, government, and traditions of the United States. Independence Day is the national day of the United States.
  - Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is a nucleic acid that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living organisms (with the exception of RNA viruses). The main role of DNA molecules is the long-term storage of information. Deoxyribonucleic acid is often compared to a set of blueprints, like a recipe or a code, since it contains the instructions needed to construct other components of cells, such as proteins and RNA molecules. The deoxyribonucleic acid segments that carry this genetic information are called genes, but other DNA sequences have structural
purposes, or are involved in regulating the use of this genetic information.
