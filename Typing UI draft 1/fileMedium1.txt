The word "astronaut" comes from the Greek words meaning "star" and "sailor." These men and women bring up images of bravery and amazement. They are heroes helping humans reach for the stars. When the space program began, there were only seven such people in the entire country. They all were then - or had been in the past - in the armed forces. Most of them were test pilots, used to the dangers that came from "pushing the envelope." That was only thirty six years ago, and since then much has changed. Today the Americans who make up the shuttle crews are comprised of every race, creed, color, and gender. As of May the second, there were over two hundred astronauts. NASA chooses its astronauts from a big pool of people. Lots of entries come in from all over the world; from these; roughly one hundred men and women are chosen for an hard training program every two years.
