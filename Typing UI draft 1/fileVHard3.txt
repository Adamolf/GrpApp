to beest, 'r not to beest yond is the questioneth wheth'r 'tis nobl'r in the mind to suff'r the slings and arrows of outrageous f'rtune, or to taketh arms 'gainst a flote of troubles, and by opposing endeth those folk? to kicketh the bucket: to catch but a wink; nay m're; and by a catch but a wink to sayeth we endeth the heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks yond flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation devoutly to beest wisheth'd.  To kicketh the bucket, to catch but a wink; to catch but a wink: p'rchance to dreameth: ay, th're's the rubbeth; f'r in yond catch but a wink of death what dreams may cometh at which hour we has't shuffl'd off this m'rtal coileth, wilt giveth us pauseth.
