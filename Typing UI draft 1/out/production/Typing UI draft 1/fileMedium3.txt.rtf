\f0\fs24 \cf0 The right words can right your balance. The right words can light your way. But words can also have weight. In our life and work, we have to carry what is important, and leave much of the rest behind. Life is hard, but life is also amazing. It's full of opportunities. You just have to go out there and look for them. Remember, what you look for, you will find. You must see with eyes unclouded by hate. See the good in that which is evil, and the evil in that which is good. Pledge yourself to neither side, but vow instead to preserve the balance that exists between the two.}
